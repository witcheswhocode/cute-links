# ✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:* Cute *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧ List of Links

This is for people who want to share their links (without using LinkedTree). With little knowledge of code, you can create a basic list of links and style it yourself. Follow the instructions and make it yours!

## How to customize your own list of links:

1. Clone this repo.
2. To serve locally, in terminal: `npm install http-server -g`. Type `http-server` into terminal for localhost:8080 to see it locally.
3. Set up your list of socials by adding yours to `/input/socials.json`. Add images for social buttons to `/img/` folder. You can download them in any color for free [here](https://www.iconsdb.com/).
4. Set up your list of links by adding yours to `/input/links.json`. Add images for link icons to `/img/` folder. You can download them in any color for free [here](https://www.iconsdb.com/).
5. Set up theme and colors by finding a html icon and colors that resignate with you. Add the icon you choose to the `/theme.js` file. Edit the colors by finding the CSS variables to edit at the top of `/styles.css`. Follow the instructions/comments and play with the themes already created.
6. Once you are happy with your links, publish to Github and set up Github Pages by going to Settings>Pages. You will need to make this repo public in order to do so.
